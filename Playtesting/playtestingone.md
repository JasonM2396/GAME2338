**Question:** During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.
> _Answer:_ Yes the rules of the game were understandable and simple. The controls were displayed when you started the game and the gameplay was understandable.

**Question:** During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?
> _Answer:_ I noticed that the enemies have visible HP. Although this is great for Casual or Intermediate gamers, I think visible HP shouldn't be in the game unless its a boss type enemy.

**Question:** Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?
> _Answer:_ Some parts of the game feel unbalanced due to the large amounts of enemies and awkward controls for changing different lasers. Based on this imbalance, Turbo Tank Redux definitely applies to Hardcore gamers due to its tough difficulty in later areas of the level.

**Question:** Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?
> _Answer:_ Since Turbo Tank Redux DX is an action only has one level and is a demo, the timing doesn't feel right for those wanting more levels. I was able to beat the game in under 20 minutes with a good amount of skill and finding the extra lives in some of the areas.

**Question:** During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?
> _Answer:_ Although the mechanics of controlling a tank went very well, being in space looked a little off since you are controlling a tank. The theme didn't go well since it was mainly dark and the black background didn't make to much sense.

**Question:** Did you have fun playing this game?
> _Answer:_ Yes, I definitely enjoyed Turbo Tank Redux DX. Despite it only being one level it provided tons of action, a tough challenge and simple to navigate controls made

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
> _Answer:_ I didn't really notice any issues during gameplay, the only thing that I had problems with were the control stick controls, probably because I didn't use a proper controller. There was also no pause function, only exiting the game. Finding an area with no enemies is your only way if you don't want to take any damage while on a break.
