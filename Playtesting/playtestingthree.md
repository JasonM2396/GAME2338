**Question:** During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.
> _Answer:_ The rules of the game could have been more understandable if the instructions were to be displayed when the game is started.

**Question:** During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?
> _Answer:_ When the game is over, it says "Press Fire to Continue". Pressing any button will make the game go back to the title screen, pressing another button will start the game over. If it says "Press Fire to Continue" and it starts the game over, then what's the point of having that being said? I think this would confuse some players thinking that you can continue in the game, but they realize that they need to start over.

**Question:** Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?
> _Answer:_ This game's balance can be a bit finicky due to the slippery controls of the vehicle. Based on that imbalance, the target audience would be for the Hardcore gamers. My reason is that the player should have prior knowledge of playing games similar games to Pico Racer.

**Question:** Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?
> _Answer:_ The timing of this game depends on the player's skills. If the player doesn't know what to do, the timing won't be right due to the game having a timer.

**Question:** During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?
> _Answer:_ Your answer here

**Question:** Did you have fun playing this game?
> _Answer:_ I had a good amount of fun although the controls took some time to get used to controls and to control the car. Overall, its a fun game for those who like 1980's style racers. However though, the obstacles, tight turns and that one dark area frustrates me.

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
> _Answer:_ The issue only I ever encountered was the no audio issue, even when the audio is turned on.
