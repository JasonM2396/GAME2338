# Game Review for In Out

## Details

### Game Title
In Out by subpixel. Play here: https://subpixel.itch.io/inout

### Rating
I'm going to give In Out a 7 out of 10 stars.

## Summary
In Out is a side scrolling, action survival like game by subpixel. Your goal is to use the environment to defeat as much enemies as you can until you fall. The enemies come from both sides so be aware of any enemies that may approach you. Moving from each side helps so you would see enemies from further areas.

The gameplay of In Out is very simple

## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.
