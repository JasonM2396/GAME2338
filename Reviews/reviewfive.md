# Game Review for In Out

## Details

### Game Title
In Out by subpixel. Play here: https://subpixel.itch.io/inout

### Rating
I'm going to give In Out a 7 out of 10 stars.

## Summary
In Out is a side scrolling, action survival like game by subpixel. Your goal is to use the environment to defeat as much enemies as you can until you fall. The enemies come from both sides so be aware of any enemies that may approach you. Moving from each side helps so you would see enemies from further areas.

The gameplay of In Out is very simple, you use the left and right arrow keys to move, X to absorb the flames with your torch, and press the up key to jump. Holding the up arrow would make you character jump multiple times, which can be useful against unexpected enemies. The gameplay and area is endless, so move in both directions and survive as long as you can.

## Final Thoughts
What I liked about In Out was the use of the environment as a method of attack. Its was a very unique concept and I think any dungeon based levels that utilize magic should have this.
