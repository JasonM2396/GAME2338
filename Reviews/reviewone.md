## Summary
  Shadowless is about an adventurous wanderer that is without a shadow; he doesn't remember much about his past. He later hears that the Queen of Shadows takes those that are shadows to do her bidding. He embarks on an adventure to stop the Queen's minion horde to learn the truth of himself and his shadow.

  Your goal in Shadowless is to fight hordes of enemies, collect items and level up your character. The control scheme takes some time to get used to, but once you play through the game you should be able to understand the controls. When you first start the game you are granted with a tutorial on how to play Shadowless. Doing this tutorial will show you how to play the game and master your armory.

  Your basic controls are moving and jumping. You move with the arrow keys and press up or Space to jump. Using your short-range weapon is the X key, the long-range weapon is the C key, collecting an item is the A key, and trashing an item is the T key. You have two weapons to choose from, a short range and long range weapon. You can change your weapons by collecting them from downed enemies. Short-range weapons can be knives, swords, etc., and long-range weapons are usually crossbows. When an enemy drops a weapon, you can get close to the dropped weapon it will show some stats if it can boost or deplete certain stats. Trashing an item means that you are selling the item, as you have in-game currency. You can use the in-game to spend on items, weapons, upgrades, etc. Selling items will increase your in-game currency.

  Leveling up the character is also very important, as it makes your character stronger and helps off defend against tougher enemies in later levels. You can talk to certain NPC's in the game to give you a list of upgrades and statistics you need. Some of these upgrades include attack power, defense, increase attack misses from foes, health, etc. Visiting these NPC's can be quite useful when you are going face off against enemies that are more fierce compared to earlier levels. Use these upgrades wisely.

## Final Thoughts
If you are a fan of RPG's and side scrolling platformers, then you will like this game. However, I wished that the puzzles on some areas would be more simple to solve, without requiring you to exit in areas like dungeons. The control scheme could have been better as it took time for me to get used too. In spite of these caveats, Shadowless is game to check out for those who are fans of RPG platformers.
