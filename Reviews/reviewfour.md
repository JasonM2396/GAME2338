## Summary
Run 3 is a 3D platformer by Kongregate and developed by Joseph Cloutier and Alex Ostroff. Run 3 is the third game of the Run series of 3D web platformers. The goal of Run 3 is to run all the way to the finish of each level until you beat every single level. Each level will get harder, and the shape or the level structure may change.

The gameplay of Run 3 is simple and easy to learn. You play as a little alien running through levels while trying the reach the end of each level. You move the alien by pressing Left or Right, and you jump by pressing Space. Touching the corners of the wall will flip the screen to the next platform you have touched Be careful with the empty spots, on those sections you will need to jump. Be careful with the grey platforms, as those will crumble and will fall into space.

If you fall out of the level, you will start over from the very beginning. You can unlock other characters when you beat certain levels. For example, in level 10 you will unlock the Skater. The Skater is faster and jumps higher, but is a lot harder to control due to faster speed and jump height. There are more characters to unlock along the way. In the main menu, you can use your mouse pointer on a locked character to see what condition you need to achieve to unlock that said character.

Your progress is saved in Run 3 even if you quit the game, which is good so you can come back to a certain point in the game. Secret levels can be found after completing certain levels. Secret levels tend to be harder than the main levels so definitely play the regular levels before working your way into the secret levels.


## Final Thoughts
One thing I like about Run 3 is that all of your progress is saved in web browser you are using, secret levels and unlockable characters. One thing I didn't like is that your character jumped like they were on the moon, but it makes sense as its in space. One cool thing is that you can do small taps on the space keys to jump low, holding the space bar makes the character jump higher. Those who played the prior Run games will be familiar with Run 3.
