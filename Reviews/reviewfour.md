## Summary
Run 3 is a 3D platformer by Kongregate and developed by Joseph Cloutier and Alex Ostroff. Run 3 is the third game of the Run series of 3D web platformers. The goal of Run 3 is to run all the way to the finish of each level until you advanced to each level. Each level will get harder and the shape or the level structure may change.



## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.
