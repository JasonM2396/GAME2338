## Summary
Run 3 is a 3D platformer by Kongregate and developed by Joseph Cloutier and Alex Ostroff. Run 3 is the third game of the Run series of 3D web platformers. The goal of Run 3 is to run all the way to the finish of each level until you advanced to each level. Each level will get harder and the shape or the level structure may change.

The gameplay of Run 3 is very simple; you play as a little alien running levels while trying the reach the end. You move the alien by press Left or Right, and you jump by pressing Space. Touching the corner of the wall will flip the screen to the next platform you have touched Be careful with the empty spots, on those sections you will need to jump; also be careful with the grey platforms, as those crumble and will fall into space.

If you fall out of the level, you will start over from the very beginning. You can unlock other characters when you beat certain levels, in level 10 you will unlock the Skater. The Skater is faster and jumps higher, but is a lot harder to control due to fast speed and jump height. There is more characters to unlock, you can move your mouse pointer on a locked character to see what condition you need to achieve to unlock that said character.

Your progress is saved in Run 3 even if you quit the game, which is a good thing so you can come back to a certain point in the game. Secret levels can be found after completing certain levels. Secret levels tend to be harder than the main levels so definitely go play the regular levels before working your way to the secret levels.


## Final Thoughts
One thing I like about Run 3 is that all of your progress is saved in web browser you are using, secret levels and unlockable characters. Those who played the prior Run games will be familiar with Run 3.
