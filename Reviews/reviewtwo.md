## Summary
Xeodrifter is about an interstellar drifter that is traveling around space on a simple mission of exploration. However, his warp core gets damaged by an asteroid, and now he embarks on adventure to visit four nearby planets in order to repair his warp core.

Xeodrifter is a Metroidvania style game, and mainly draws inspiration of the Metroid series of games. Although the four planets can be visited in any order, upgrades and power ups are need for longer periods of exploration and to gain access to new areas from each level.

## Final Thoughts
I would highly recommend Xeodrifter if you are a fan of Metroidvania style games or there is a sale. What I didn't like about Xeodrifter is the lack of a tutorial, lack of save points (only at the start of each level), and confusing direction. Speaking of confusing direction, sometimes you have to explore each level to know where you are supposed to go, which can be time consuming. Despite these caveats, Xeodrifter is a game to check out if you like run and gun platformers.
