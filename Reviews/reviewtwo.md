## Summary
The plot of Xeodrifter is about an interstellar drifter that is traveling around space on a simple mission of exploration. However, his spaceship gets damaged by an asteroid while exploring, and now he embarks on an adventure to visit to explore four nearby planets to look for parts to repair his spaceship.

Xeodrifter is a Metroidvania style platforming game developed by Renegade Kid. Xeodrifter mainly draws inspiration from the Metroid series of games and borrows similar elements and style to that said series. Although the four planets can be visited and done in any order, some planets may have upgrades which are urgent. Each planet has a different environment and layout. You will also meet bosses and tougher enemies in later parts of each level, so be prepared when you are about to face a boss.

The gameplay in Xeodrifter is fairly simple if you know how to play platformers. You play as an interstellar drifter that is exploring four planets finding parts to repair his damaged spaceship. The controls are similar to most run and gun games. The **d-pad** moves the character, the **X button** shoots, and the **A**  button jumps. When you are at the planet selection, use the **A** button to accelerate the spaceship, press the d-pad to move, and press the **B** button to dock your ship on a selected planet..

Collecting upgrades and power-ups are urgent because they are required for some levels and to gain access to new areas in each level. The top planet has an upgrade to get a submarine, which is a requirement for the other levels. You can also collect health pickups, which will increase your overall health. You start with 3 health circles, losing all health circles results in a game over. When you are about to start a level, use the save points by pressing up to save your progress.


## Final Thoughts
I would highly recommend Xeodrifter if you are a fan of Metroidvania style games or there is a sale. What I didn't like about Xeodrifter is the lack of a tutorial, lack of save points (only at the start of each level), hard to obtain health, and a confusing direction on where the player should go. Speaking of confusing direction, sometimes you have to explore each level to know where you are supposed to go, which can be time-consuming. Despite these caveats, Xeodrifter is a game to check out if you like Metroidvania style platformers.
