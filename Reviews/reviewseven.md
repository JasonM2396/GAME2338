## Summary
Rhythm Doctor is a rhythm game you have to press a single button when the beat lines reach the seventh note. Most rhythm games have mulitple buttons to press, but this one just has one. Despite the simplicity, the game gets tougher the more levels you progress within the game.

## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.
