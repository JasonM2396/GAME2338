## Summary
VVVVVV is a 2D puzzle platform game created by Terry Cavanagh and published by Nicalis. Unlike most platforming games, you cannot jump. Instead, you reverse your characters' gravity by pressing the jump button when on a surface. There are no locks, no power ups, no switches, nothing that can stop the player from making progress except the challenges of VVVVVV itself. VVVVVV is also known as "The Letter V Six Times".



## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.
