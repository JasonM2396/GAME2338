## Summary
VVVVVV is a 2D puzzle platform game created by Terry Cavanagh, and the console versions are published by Nicalis. Unlike most platforming games, you cannot jump. Instead, you reverse your characters' gravity by pressing the jump button when on a surface. There are no locks, no power ups, no switches, nothing that can stop the player from making progress except the challenges of VVVVVV itself. VVVVVV is also known as "The Letter V Six Times".

You play as Captain Viridian, the leader of  a crew of dimensional scientists whom their ship crashes due to a dimensional interference. After the crash, everyone escapes but they are teleported to random dimensions or areas, leaving the Captain alone. Its up to him to save his crew and bring them to safety.

The gameplay play of VVVVVV is very simple, yet the game itself is very challenging. You move with the arrow keys or WASD keys, reverse gravity by pressing the space, up, down, W or S keys, and pressing Enter key brings up stats or displays info.

## Final Thoughts
One aspect I really liked about VVVVVV was that you can reverse gravity rather than jumping, which is a very unique concept and gameplay style.
